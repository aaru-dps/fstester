DiscImageChef Filesystem Testers
================================

This folder contains source code for snippets designed to retrieve special features
(e.g. extended attributes) from all files on installed volumes (getters) as well as snippets
designed to create known files with all features specific to an
operating system / filesystem combination to reverse engineer them and/or test
DiscImageChef filesystem implementations.
